		<h2>The History of Team SoloMid</h2>
	</div>

		<div class="history">
		<p>Team SoloMid was founded by Reginald in September 2009 as a League of Legends community website and playing guide resource. In 2011, the organization began fielding a team in professional LoL competitions. The original roster consisted of Reginald, SaintVicious, Chaox, TheOddOne, and Locodoco. Reginald retired from competitive play at the end of 2013, opting to run the business full-time.</p>

		<p>On December 22, 2014, a group of grey hat hackers known as Null Consolidated claimed to have hacked into the SoloMid.net servers. The hackers vandalized the community website by replacing it with obscene imagery. They also claimed to have obtained thousands of user account data, but said they would not be releasing any of it.</p>

		<p>On January 25, 2015, TSM acquired the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive roster of Team Dignitas. The Daily Dot reported that following their signing, the players became the highest paid CS:GO players in the world at the time.</p>

		<p>On March 15, 2015, TSM's League of Legends team won their first Intel Extreme Masters World Championship in Katowice, Poland.</p>

		<p>In April 2015, TSM signed Super Smash Bros. Melee player Leffen as their first fighting game player. August 1, 2015, TSM announced the signing of ZeRo to their Super Smash Bros. division. ZeRo would go on to achieve 56 straight tournament wins in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, a feat recorded in the Guinness World Records. On January 12, 2018, ZeRo announced his retirement from the Super Smash Bros. competitive scene due to his lack of motivation to go further with his career, and on November 8, 2018, TSM announced that ZeRo had departed from the team.</p>


		<p>To this day TSM is known worldwide for all of its players in almost every section of gaming there is today, TSM continues to grow their rosters and their popularity day in and day out.</p>
